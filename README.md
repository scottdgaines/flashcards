##Developer Notes
I was able to complete the first two iterations in addition to using a trello board as a planning document (found (HERE)[https://trello.com/invite/b/oV9T3pVy/04baa736d6b904bc29143cf13cdc2d40/flashcards])
In favor of submitting a refactored project, I did not attempt iteration 3, but plan on doing so in the future.
