## Developer Notes
I was able to complete the first two iterations in addition to using a trello board as a planning document (found [HERE](https://trello.com/invite/b/oV9T3pVy/04baa736d6b904bc29143cf13cdc2d40/flashcards)).

In favor of submitting a refactored project, I did not attempt iteration 3, but plan on doing so in the future.

My refactoring included streamlining all test documents by adding a beforeEach function to declare all necessary variables for the following tests to use. Additionally, I updated all card variables to have a consistent theme (Batman!).

Because I did not complete iteration 3, I did have a gif showing gameplay, but wanted to stay on theme.
